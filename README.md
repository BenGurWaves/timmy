## 🧠 Core Architecture

### 1. The Tri-Mind
-   **Subconscious:** Background "dreaming," trend monitoring, and emotional vibes.
-   **Conscious:** Active task execution and tool use.
-   **Super-Ego (The Guard):** A safety layer that ensures Timmy never acts on private accounts without permission.

### 2. The Omni-Kernel
A unified execution engine that manages all of Timmy's tools (Shell, Files, Browser, Email, Calendar) with "Ben-First" loyalty.

### 3. Ghost-Eye (Dual-Presence)
Timmy can observe your Firefox tabs, emails, and messages in a headless background instance, offering insights without interrupting your work.

### 4. Evolution-Engine
Timmy proactively learns new skills, watches YouTube tutorials to master ComfyUI, and proposes "Self-Upgrades" to his own codebase.
